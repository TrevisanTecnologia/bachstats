What's on the list?
-------------------

*  User control (admin and viewers)
	* Viewers see kpi attached to its name
	* Admins can change trend limits
	
* Create a trending line on graphics

* Enable to load csv files (try a big textarea and then a process wizard)

* Build a cockpit UI where one can examine specific kpis. 

* Enable period selection from kpis. Need to find a way to filter since the unit is not a standard. Maybe add a date to it? 

* How to manage trending limits? Up and down limits.
